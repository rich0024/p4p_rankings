# P4pRankings

Welcome to P4pRankings, a gem which allows one to view the CURRENT, top 50, pound for pound fighters of the WORLD. In addition to being able to view a list of the top fighters, P4pRankings adds an extra layer by allowing one to view every fighter's wins, losses and draws. This gem helps fight fans answer the question, "who is the current best" by being able to view where a fighter stands amongst other current greats.
